## General Information
- Goal is to determine the demand for shared bikes with the available variables
- Based on the model, the BoomBikes management will be able to develop their business strategy
- Team has analysed 11 variables with relevant data
- Exploratory data analysis has been conducted for all continuous and categorical variables
- Team has considered both the casual and registered users

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Actual temperature or feels like temperature are the biggest determining factors for cycle renting.
- Weather conditions (snow and windspeed) are the other factors.
- For fitting the model, yr is important condition but this is assuming company getting more popular year to year.
- Working day is important variable but cannot be determined for overall user count. Upon further investigating with casual and registered users, it is an extremely important variable. It has negative correlation with casual users and positive correlation with registered users.
